# OurMeshDev
MeshDev(http://meshdev.sourceforge.net) is a mesh comparison software. It accepts two meshes as input. 
MeshDev return numerical values and optionaly visual results (with a pseudo-colored mesh corresponding to the measured deviation).
The demo is too old and i try to add some features to satisify my requirements.
